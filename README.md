# EIC Afterburner

Post processing analysis software for fun4all event evaluator output trees

## Prerequisites

LHAPDF6 is required. Installation instructions are [here](https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/install.html).

fastjet is also required. You can install it with `external/install_fastjet.sh`.

If you install LHAPDF to `external/install`, you can setup an environment by sourcing
`external/setup_cpp.sh` (although only tested when fastjet is also installed).
